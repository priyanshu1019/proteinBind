## 🧬 Protein Data Processing
This section covers the protein data processing pipeline, including loading protein structure files (e.g., PDB format), performing molecular docking simulations, and visualizing the results.

Protein Structure Input
Users can upload PDB files for protein structures, which will then be processed by NVIDIA NeMo's protein-folding models.

Docking Simulation
Using molecular docking algorithms, the system predicts how small molecules (such as drug candidates) bind to protein targets.
